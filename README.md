# Notre Dame MSDS Class of 2019: Group 1 DataViz Project

## Code that feeds a <a href = "https://alanski.shinyapps.io/Group1EastFinalProjectApp/">shiny app</a> with information about districts in South Bend, Indiana.

<li>Each group member selected a topic to focus on and designed that page of the app.</li>
<li>The group as a whole compiled the various scripts into the final code. </li>
<li>I volunteered to host the repository and publish the result.  My contribution is the page about parks.</li>
